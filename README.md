# Shape Shift
A very creatively-named game based on the theme "Shapeshift"
# Usage
Run main.py in the src folder
# Gameplay
Move your shape up and down with the arrow keys and change your shape with numbers 3-6 (the number corresponds to the number of sides the shape you want has). Move through the lines of shapes that come towards you while matching their shape.

There are two powerups: the shield and autoswitch.

![Shield powerup](src/assets/shield.png)
The shield saves you from otherwise certain death one time.

![Autoswitch powerup](src/assets/autoswitch.png)
The autoswitch, once activated with the space bar, will automatically match shapes for you for a short time.
